      "question": "What is one of the vulnerabilities associated with smart contracts?",

        "a": "Re-entrance",
        "b": "Denial of Service",
        "c": "Cross-Site Scripting",
        "d": "SQL Injection"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Re-entrance vulnerability allows an attacker to repeatedly enter a function and manipulate the contract's state.",
        "b": "Denial of Service attacks aim to disrupt the availability of a service or resource, but it's not specific to smart contracts.",
        "c": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability in web applications, not directly related to smart contracts.",
        "d": "SQL Injection is a vulnerability in database systems, not relevant to smart contracts."

      "question": "What can occur when a smart contract does not properly handle arithmetic operations?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Arithmetic overflow",
        "b": "Syntax error",
        "c": "Memory leak",
        "d": "Infinite loop"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Arithmetic overflow happens when a calculation produces a result greater than the maximum value that can be stored.",
        "b": "Syntax errors are related to incorrect code structure, not arithmetic operations.",
        "c": "Memory leaks refer to inefficient memory usage and are not directly related to arithmetic operations.",
        "d": "Infinite loops occur when a program gets stuck in a repeating sequence of operations, but it's not specifically related to arithmetic."

      "question": "Which vulnerability allows unauthorized access to private data within a smart contract?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Accessing private data",
        "b": "Buffer overflow",
        "c": "Command injection",
        "d": "Remote code execution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Accessing private data vulnerability enables attackers to retrieve sensitive information stored within a smart contract.",
        "b": "Buffer overflow is a memory-related vulnerability, not directly related to accessing private data in smart contracts.",
        "c": "Command injection is a vulnerability in command-line interfaces or systems, not specific to smart contracts.",
        "d": "Remote code execution involves running malicious code on a remote system, not directly related to accessing private data in smart contracts."
