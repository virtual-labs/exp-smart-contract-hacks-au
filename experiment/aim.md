### Aim of the Experiment

The aim of this experiment is to explore common vulnerabilities in smart contractsâ€”self-executing programs that run on blockchain platforms by examining re-entrancy attacks, integer overflow and underflow, and unauthorized access to private data. The experiment demonstrates how these vulnerabilities can be exploited and highlights their potential impact on the security and reliability of smart contracts.
