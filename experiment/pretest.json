      "question": "What is a smart contract?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A legal document stored on a blockchain",
        "b": "A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code",

        "c": "Incorrect. Smart contracts involve code execution, not electronic signatures.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Smart contracts involve written code executed on a blockchain, providing transparency and automation."
